The short description using inline R code:

This is a dataset containing information about penguins. For the size of
the datasize, There are 344 rows and 8 cols. Meaning that 344 penguins
were included in the dataset and for each penguin we had 8 study
variables. The 8 variables in the Penguins dataset are species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
year. From the important variables like “Species” or “Island”, We
learned that there are three species of penguins (Adelie,Chinstrap and
Gentoo) in the dataset from the three islands(Biscoe,Dream and
Torgersen).We can also know the distribution of bill Depth/Length and
flipper length, body mass,the sex of these penguins. We can use the mean
value to estimate some important variables. The mean flipper length of
the penguins is 200.9152047mm. The mean body mass is 4201.754386g. The
mean bill length and bill depth are 43.9219298mm and 17.1511696mm
respectively. The data are collected from 2007 to 2009.

Make a scatterplot

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=penguins,aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm,color=species))+ geom_point()
```

\##Problem 2

X1 is the random sample x2 is the logical vector x3 is the character
vector x4 is the factor vector

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──

``` r
example_df = tibble(
x1 = rnorm(10),
x2 = x1 > 0,
x3= c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","k"),
x4 = factor(c("Small", "Medium", "Small", "Small","Large", "Large", "Medium","Large","Medium","Small"))
)
example_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##        x1 x2    x3    x4    
    ##     <dbl> <lgl> <chr> <fct> 
    ##  1 -0.717 FALSE a     Small 
    ##  2  1.34  TRUE  b     Medium
    ##  3  0.163 TRUE  c     Small 
    ##  4 -0.451 FALSE d     Small 
    ##  5 -0.249 FALSE e     Large 
    ##  6  0.562 TRUE  f     Large 
    ##  7 -1.41  FALSE g     Medium
    ##  8 -0.212 FALSE h     Large 
    ##  9 -0.568 FALSE i     Medium
    ## 10 -0.286 FALSE k     Small

We take the mean of the variables

``` r
mean_x1 = mean(pull(example_df,x1))
mean_x2 = mean(pull(example_df,x2))
mean_x3 = mean(pull(example_df,x3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, x3)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_x4 = mean(pull(example_df,x4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, x4)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

The x1(a random sample/Numeric vector) and x2(The logical vector) can be
used to take the mean. But the X3(character vector) and X4(factor
vector) can Not be used to take the mean.

``` r
### convert logical vector into numeric vector
pull(example_df,x2)
x2_num = as.numeric(example_df$x2)
mean(x2_num)
### convert character vector into numeric vector
pull(example_df,x3)
x3_num = as.numeric(example_df$x3)
mean(x3_num)
### convert factor vector into numeric vector
pull(example_df,x4)
x4_num = as.numeric(example_df$x4)
mean(x4_num)
```

Based on the console, we can not convert character vector into numeric
vector. Because the elements in character can not be treated like a
certain number.

But the logical vector can be converted into numeric value. Since the
True or False can be converted into ” 1 or 0”

And the factor vector can also be converted into numeric value. The
value of “Small/Medium/Large” can be converted into ” 3/2/1”

This helps me to explain what happens before when i try to take the
mean. As long as this vector can be converted into numeric vector, (The
elements in the vector can be treated like numeric value) then we can
calculate the mean value.
